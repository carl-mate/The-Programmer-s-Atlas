# The Programmer's Atlas
The Programmer's Atlas is a 2D jigsaw puzzle game variant of &quot;Are you smarter than a
5th grader show&quot;. 

The user&#39;s primary goal is to correctly answer 11 questions based on
programming paradigms in order to unlock (1) all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that depict an
important figure in the field of programming and computer science and (2) specific letters that
will serve as clues of the figure&#39;s name. The questions fall into two main categories: (1)
theoretical questions and (2) programming questions.Â 

Furthermore, the user will have the ability to choose from three lifelines in case the
question gets too tricky: (1) Ask Google, (2) Ask a Colleague, and (3) Call a family member.
However, the user will only have one chance throughout the entire game. If the user answers
incorrectly, then he/she is out of the running for the ultimate prize and only gets to keep any
money he/she previously won. If the user can answer all 11 questions correctly, then he/she will
get the chance to win double the prize money of $ 1,000,000 by gambling his/her money and will
receive the ultimate prize of $ 2,000,000.
